# Project-Concern
Walking down a marketplace and there are people who are downtrodden. You have to go and help them BUT there are people in the way because this is a crowded marketplace. If you donâ€™t help people your movements become slower and your vision darkened. If you do help, you become faster and can see more but the crowds become thicker.
